**DRUG RESISTANCE**

Drug resistance is a widely recognized occurrence that arises once illnesses advance a tolerance to medicinal therapies. This idea was initially explored when bacteria developed resistance to specific antibiotics, yet, it has been discovered that other illnesses, such as cancer, also exhibit comparable processes [1]. However, certain forms of drug resistance are specific to disease conditions, while other mechanisms like drug efflux, which is seen in human drug-resistant malignancies and microbes have evolved to be conserved over time [2]. Many types of tumors are initially responsive to chemotherapy, but, the above mechanism (drug efflux) and other processes, like DNA mutations and metabolic alterations that the inhibition and degradation of medication, can cause tumors to become resistant to the treatment over time [3].
